	The day had started out fine. You woke up, put on your best clothes, hitched the horses to the wagon, and headed out
to town. Supplies have been running low so a trip to restock was in order. The trip to town was nice, as the road meandered 
through the forest where sunlight was filtered by the green leaves. Then through the meadows, full of colorful wild flowers.
Finally, the town hove into view and you were navigating your team through the tight streets bordered by buildings that
were two, maybe even three, stories tall. The roads were full of horses, people, and wagons and progress was slow, but you
didn't mind, because you weren't in a hurry.
	As luck would have it, though, a wagon was leaving a spot in front of the shop you were headed for. You angled your 
wagon towards the newly vacant spot, barely noticing a a wagon team coming in the opposite direction. You pulled into the
vacant spot, hopping down from the wagon to tie up the horses.
