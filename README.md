# DungeonOfDangeresque
A "plus" version of Dungeons of Danger

03/13/2020: Jeez. When not having to compare everything I do to BASIC, I can find an awful
lot of bugs in my own code. Which I did. Several of which need to be fixed in the DoD-non-
esque. Besides that, I've added more levels. Now it's a random amount between 5 and 9. For
a while, they were all identical, but I fixed it. I'm still not all that impressed with Python, but
maybe it was my mistake.
			Otherwise, I haven't done much. Just getting the multiple dungeons to work
took up quite a lot of time. But, upwards and onwards, I reckon.

03/09/2020: Having so much fun with that wacky Python and Dungeon of Danger, I decided that there can be some updates done.
Such as:
1) More levels to the dungeon
2) More monsters
3) More traps

So far, I've made changes to allow for more dungeon levels. That should be done in a fairly short time. The other stuff
requires some thinking about what to add.
